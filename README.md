# Word-Guesser

## Introduction

This was another project I used to try out React. It is a clone of [Wordle by Powerlanguage](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) in React using Tailwind CSS. It also integrates a German language setting! ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. 

This is a project that I may or may not return to and tidy up. As it stands, the game logic could do with refactoring and the animations libraries need tightened up as there are multiple currently in use. However, it should function as intended other than settings features which aren't implemented.

## Setup
